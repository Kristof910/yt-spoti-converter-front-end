Welcome!

This is the front-end version of the YouTube -> Spotify Converter web application, you just have to run the flask app with the api back-end so you can use the application, before you use it fill the setup.py file!

The website is at: http://localhost:9874

Link to the api back-end: https://github.com/Kristof910/yt-spoti-converter/tree/api-endpoint-version

Thank you!
