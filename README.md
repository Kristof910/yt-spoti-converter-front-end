Welcome!

This is the front-end version of the YouTube -> Spotify Converter web application, you just have to run the flask app with the api back-end so you can use the application, before you use it fill the setup.py file and head to your Spotify Developer Dashboard because you also need to add into the Redirect URIs section this link: http://localhost:9874/callback

The website to access the app is at: http://localhost:9874

Link to the api back-end: https://github.com/Kristof910/yt-spoti-converter/tree/api-endpoint-version

Thank you!
